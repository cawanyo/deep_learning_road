This is an implementation of neural network from scratch
The objective is to understand the concepts of neural network
  1. Learn the creation of the network
  2. The initializer
  3. The loss
  4. 4The algorithm use to learn and update parameters

After writing this When i use deeplearning framework i understand 
almost everything I m wrinting and what it does

In this implementation i build a binary classification 
But the principle is the same if you want to expand it
You just need to add the loss you want and it derivative 

Clone it and try everithing you want
